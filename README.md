# Kenshi Mod Manager
It's a working (although messy in code) Mod Manager for Kenshi.

## Why?
Why not?

For real though, i have always used Mod Organizer for bethesda games to sort my load order, so when i started modding kenshi i got tired of all the clicking up and down for mods to be sorted.
So when i wanted to play kenshi again after a little break i decided to make a mod manager first so i can sort my mods easier.
This was also at the same time a practice for me since im building this application in python, a language i wanted to get more familiar with.
